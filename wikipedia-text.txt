The guiding principles for the 
program informed the most recent updates to the Grants 
Work Group Charter, which we go into further in Part 3 of this 
update. PSF Staff devoted many hours running different scenarios
 based on grant data to understand what impact different changes will
 have on our community and on our financial sustainability. The PSF 
  Board worked with Staff over the past couple of months weighing the 
  pros and cons of each change, taking extra meetings,
   reviewing documents, figures, and more. PSF Staff translated the outcome of all this work into proposed changes to the Grants Work 
 Group Charter.

The PSF Board approved updates to the Grants Work Group Charter during the 
December 11, 2024, PSF Board meeting. Our newly established Grants Program
 guiding principles commit to transparency and communication. 
 Along those lines, the changes to the Grants Program will take 
 effect on March 1, 2025. To implement the corresponding updates 
 across our documentation, application form, and grant report form, 
 we will be pausing incoming Grants requests for the entire month of
February 2025. Any applications already in the system will be 
 processed normally. Make sure to read Part 3 in this series to
understand if the changes impact any events or initiatives
 you organize.
